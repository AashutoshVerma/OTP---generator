# OTP---generator

They say " The time gone never comes back.". This hit me so hard that I came up with the idea to make a OTP generator program which produces different OTP every time with a particular algorithm for it to encrypt and send it to the concerned the person via mail , which the server could decrypt to authorize the user. I used the time ,smpt and email.messages modules in python to make this program ,the way I wanted .

PRE-REQUISITES:
Enable your "less secure app access" functionality from your email account which you will use to send the mails. here's the link to enable it. This is the critical step, without this you won't be able to execute the task. https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en

note: do not worry, enabling this functionality won't trouble you as it allows other mediums as python SMTP protocol to send mail, nothing else :)
